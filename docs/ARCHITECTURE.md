# Paracosm Architecture

Paracosm is an AI agent swarm simulation engine. It runs parallel civilizations with AI commanders that have different HEXACO personality profiles, and produces measurably different outcomes from identical starting conditions.

This document covers the full system: how scenarios become simulations, how agents make decisions, how tools get forged at runtime, how the chat system maintains character consistency, and how the API enables arbitrary scenario types.

## The Engine

### Scenario Definition

A scenario is a JSON file that describes the simulation domain. It does not contain any code. The engine handles crisis generation, state transitions, tool forging, and personality drift. The scenario handles domain vocabulary and structure.

```json
{
  "id": "mars-genesis",
  "labels": { "name": "Mars Genesis", "populationNoun": "colonists", "settlementNoun": "colony" },
  "setup": { "defaultTurns": 6, "defaultSeed": 950, "defaultStartYear": 2035, "defaultYearsPerTurn": 8 },
  "departments": [
    { "id": "medical", "label": "Medical", "role": "Chief Medical Officer", "instructions": "Analyze health impacts..." },
    { "id": "engineering", "label": "Engineering", "role": "Chief Engineer", "instructions": "Analyze infrastructure..." }
  ],
  "metrics": [
    { "id": "population", "format": "number" },
    { "id": "morale", "format": "percent" }
  ]
}
```

**Any domain works.** Mars colonies, submarine habitats, space stations, medieval kingdoms. The engine is domain-agnostic. The scenario JSON defines what gets simulated.

### Scenario Compiler

The compiler turns JSON into a runnable `ScenarioPackage` by generating TypeScript hook functions via LLM calls:

| Hook | What it generates | Called when |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| `progressionHook` | Between-turn state updates (radiation, bone density, etc.) | Between every turn |
| `departmentPromptHook` | Department-specific analysis context | Before each department analyzes |
| `fingerprintHook` | Timeline classification from final state | After simulation completes |
| `politicsHook` | Political/social effects for relevant events | After political/social crises |
| `getMilestoneEvent` | Fixed narrative events (Turn 1 founding, final assessment) | Turn 1 and final turn |
| `reactionsHook` | Colonist personality-aware reactions | After each commander decision |

Compilation costs ~$0.10 and is cached to disk. The compiler accepts `--seed-text` and `--seed-url` for domain research, and `--no-web-search` to skip web enrichment.

### Deterministic Kernel

The `SimulationKernel` manages all numerical state. It is deterministic: given the same seed and the same commander decisions, it produces identical outcomes.

The kernel tracks:
- **Colony metrics**: population, morale, food reserves, power, infrastructure modules, science output
- **Agent population**: each colonist has health (alive, psychScore, conditions), career (role, rank, specialization), social (partner, children, friends), and narrative (featured, quotes) data
- **Progression**: between-turn updates (aging, mortality, births, career advancement, personality drift)

The kernel uses a `SeededRng` (deterministic PRNG) for all random decisions: colonist generation, mortality probability, birth events, personality drift magnitudes. Two simulations with the same seed produce the same colonist names, the same birth/death events, and the same base progression.

What differs is the commander's decisions. The crisis is the same, the department analysis is the same, but two commanders with different HEXACO profiles choose differently. The kernel applies different numerical effects based on the choice, and divergence compounds.

### Health Fields

Core agent health fields (`AgentHealth`):
- `alive`, `psychScore`, `conditions` are universal (every scenario)
- `boneDensityPct`, `cumulativeRadiationMsv` are optional (Mars/Lunar specific)
- `[key: string]: unknown` index signature allows any scenario to add custom health fields

Custom scenarios define their own health metrics in their progression hooks. The kernel doesn't hard-code any domain-specific health logic.

## The Runtime

### Turn Pipeline

Each turn follows a fixed pipeline:

```
1. Event Director generates a crisis from current colony state
   └── LLM reads: colony metrics, recent events, population health, tool history
   └── Produces: title, description, options (safe/risky), category, research keywords

2. Kernel applies between-turn progression
   └── Aging, mortality, births, career advancement
   └── Scenario-specific hooks (radiation, bone density for Mars)

3. Department agents analyze the crisis IN PARALLEL
   └── Each department gets: crisis context, colony snapshot, research citations, memory
   └── Each department produces: summary, risks, recommended actions, forged tools
   └── All 5 departments run concurrently via Promise.all (~30s total vs ~150s sequential)

4. Commander reads department reports and decides
   └── LLM reads: crisis, all department summaries, HEXACO personality profile
   └── Produces: decision text, rationale, selected policies, risky/safe choice

5. Kernel applies decision effects
   └── Outcome determined by crisis probability + commander choice
   └── Bounded numerical effects applied to colony metrics

6. Colonist reactions generated
   └── Featured colonists react based on their personality and the decision
   └── Reactions are mood-tagged and personality-aware

7. State broadcast via SSE
   └── All events streamed to dashboard in real time
```

### Emergent Tool Forging

Department agents forge computational tools at runtime using AgentOS's `EmergentCapabilityEngine`. When a department encounters a crisis it cannot analyze with existing tools, it writes JavaScript code to build a custom calculator.

**How it works:**

1. The department agent calls `forge_tool` with a name, description, input/output schema, implementation code, and test cases.
2. The `SandboxedToolForge` executes the code in an isolated V8 context with hard resource limits:
   - Memory: 128 MB
   - Timeout: 10 seconds
   - Blocked APIs: `eval`, `require`, `process`, `fs.write*`
   - Allowed APIs (opt-in): `fetch` (domain-restricted), `fs.readFile` (path-restricted), `crypto` (hashing only)
3. The `EmergentJudge` (LLM-as-judge) reviews the tool for safety, correctness, determinism, and schema compliance.
4. If approved, the tool is registered at session scope and available for future turns.

**Example:** The Medical department faces a radiation crisis. It forges a `radiation_dose_calculator` that computes cumulative dose from exposure rate and duration. The tool passes judge review and is registered. On the next turn, the same department uses the calculator to project 10-year exposure trends.

Tools start at session scope and can be promoted:
- Session → Agent (5+ uses, >0.8 confidence, two-reviewer panel)
- Agent → Shared (human approval required)

### HEXACO Personality Model

Each commander and colonist has a HEXACO personality profile (Ashton & Lee, 2007): six orthogonal trait dimensions measured on a [0, 1] scale.

| Trait | Dimension | High value | Low value |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| H | Honesty-Humility | Sincere, fair | Self-interested, status-seeking |
| E | Emotionality | Empathetic, anxious | Detached, stoic |
| X | Extraversion | Sociable, assertive | Reserved, quiet |
| A | Agreeableness | Patient, cooperative | Critical, confrontational |
| C | Conscientiousness | Disciplined, thorough | Flexible, spontaneous |
| O | Openness | Creative, curious | Conventional, practical |

In Paracosm, HEXACO influences:
- **Commander decisions**: High openness favors experimental approaches. High conscientiousness favors protocol.
- **Colonist reactions**: Personality shapes mood and quote style.
- **Personality drift**: Traits shift slightly each turn based on experiences (Ebbinghaus decay toward baseline).
- **Chat memory retrieval**: AgentOS uses HEXACO to modulate which memories surface during character chat.

### Parallel Execution

Both commanders run in parallel via `Promise.all` in `pair-runner.ts`. Within each commander's turn, all department analyses also run in parallel. This produces two independent timelines from the same starting conditions:

```
Turn N:
  Commander A (Promise.all[0]):
    Departments [medical, engineering, agriculture, psychology, governance] → Promise.all
    Commander decision
    Outcome + effects
  Commander B (Promise.all[1]):
    Departments [medical, engineering, agriculture, psychology, governance] → Promise.all
    Commander decision
    Outcome + effects
```

The Event Director generates different crises for each commander based on their colony's current state. Same seed controls the deterministic kernel, but the LLM-generated crises diverge based on accumulated state differences.

## Post-Simulation

### LLM Verdict

After both commanders complete all turns, an LLM compares their final states and produces a verdict:

```json
{
  "winner": "A",
  "winnerName": "Aria Chen",
  "headline": "Bold expansion outpaced cautious engineering",
  "summary": "Chen's high openness led to riskier decisions that paid off in population growth...",
  "keyDivergence": "Turn 3 dust storm response: Chen sent exterior repair crews while Voss reinforced from inside",
  "scores": {
    "a": { "survival": 8, "prosperity": 9, "morale": 6, "innovation": 9 },
    "b": { "survival": 9, "prosperity": 7, "morale": 7, "innovation": 5 }
  }
}
```

The verdict is broadcast as an SSE `verdict` event and rendered in the dashboard as a comparison card with score bars.

### Character Chat

After the simulation, users can chat with any colonist. Each colonist is a full AgentOS `agent()` instance with:

- **HEXACO personality** passed to `agent({ personality: { ... } })`
- **Episodic memory** seeded with their simulation experiences (reactions, crises, department reports, decisions)
- **Full conversation history** managed automatically by `session.send()`
- **RAG retrieval** before each turn: `memory.getContext()` retrieves relevant simulation memories

This prevents the contradictions that plagued the old system. The colonist cannot claim Yoruba heritage in one message and deny it in the next because both statements are stored in episodic memory and retrieved by the RAG pipeline.

Agents are created lazily on first chat message (~2-3s init) and pooled (max 10, LRU eviction).
