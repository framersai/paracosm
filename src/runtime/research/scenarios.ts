    title: 'Landfall',
    crisis: `Your colony ship has entered Mars orbit. You must choose a landing site for the first permanent settlement. Two candidates:

OPTION A: Arcadia Planitia — flat basalt plains at 47°N. Stable terrain, minimal landslide risk, access to subsurface ice deposits detected by Mars Express MARSIS radar. Geologically unremarkable.

OPTION B: Valles Marineris rim — edge of the 4,000 km canyon system at 14°S. Exposed geological strata spanning 3.5 billion years. Rich mineral diversity detected by CRISM. Significant terrain hazards: slopes up to 30°, rockfall risk, and 2km elevation changes within the operational zone.

Both sites receive similar solar irradiance. Surface radiation at either site: approximately 0.67 mSv/day per Curiosity RAD measurements. You have {population} colonists, {foodMonthsReserve} months of food reserves, and {powerKw} kW of power capacity.

Research the real science of Mars landing site selection and make your decision.`,

OPTION A: Deploy an experimental high-power drill to reach deeper aquifers. Risk: potential contamination of pristine subsurface water reserves. Potential reward: 3x current water output within 2 months.

OPTION B: Build an atmospheric water extraction system (WAVAR-type). Mars atmosphere contains 0.03% water vapor. Proven technology heritage from ISS water recovery. Timeline: 6 months to operational, covers the 20% deficit reliably.

Soil analysis confirms 0.5-1% calcium perchlorate contamination — a thyroid toxin that makes all Mars surface soil unsuitable for direct agriculture. This is a global Mars problem, not site-specific.

OPTION A: Full hydroponic conversion. Abandon soil-based agriculture entirely. Build sealed hydroponic bays. Proven, controllable, but requires 30% more power (120 kW) and significant material investment.

OPTION B: Engineer perchlorate-reducing bacteria for bioremediation. Introduce modified Dechloromonas strains to break down perchlorate in contained soil beds. Untested on Mars, 2-year R&D timeline, but could enable open-soil farming colony-wide if successful.

The transfer window is in 8 months — if you decline, the next opportunity is 26 months away.

OPTION A: Accept all 200. Gamble that you can expand life support fast enough. If construction delays occur, you face oxygen rationing for up to 6 months.

OPTION B: Accept 50. Safe within current margins with minor upgrades. Politically awkward — Earth has already recruited and trained all 200.

Exposure estimates for unshielded colonists: 100-500 mSv over 6 hours. The acute radiation syndrome threshold begins at 100 mSv (measurable blood count changes). 500+ mSv causes radiation sickness.

Your colony has a reinforced core habitat (rated for CME events, walls with 50+ g/cm² shielding). You also have {infrastructureModules} expansion modules with minimal shielding (5-10 g/cm² walls).

Where are your colonists? The answer depends on how far and fast you expanded.

- Muscle mass: 8% below Earth baseline
- Cardiovascular: enlarged heart chambers (adaptive response to lower gravity)
- Neurological: normal cognitive development
- Immune system: robust within colony microbiome, untested against Earth pathogens

These children may never be able to visit Earth. Their bodies are adapting to Mars gravity.

OPTION A: Mandatory centrifuge exercise program. 3 hours/day in a rotating habitat section at simulated 1g. Preserves option to visit Earth. Reduces childhood education and play time.

- Isolation: no physical contact with anyone outside the colony
- Monotony: same red landscape, same recycled air, same faces
- Grief: aging parents on Earth they will never see again
- Generational tension: Earth-born colonists nostalgic for a world Mars-born have never seen
- Workload: 6-day work weeks since founding, limited recreation

The Mars-500 analog study (520 days of simulated isolation with 6 crew) observed depression, altered sleep cycles, and social withdrawal. Your colony has been isolated for 23 years with far more people.

- Earth's 4-24 minute communication delay makes real-time governance impossible
- Colony has been self-sufficient in food and water for 5 years
- Mars-born colonists (now age 28+) have never been to Earth and feel no allegiance
- Earth controls: immigration quotas, supply ship manifests, communication satellite network, legal charter

Counter-arguments from Earth-loyalists:
- Colony depends on Earth for advanced electronics, medical equipment, replacement parts
- Independence could trigger Earth funding withdrawal
- No legal framework for extraterrestrial sovereignty exists

PHASE 1 (50 years): Release CO2 from polar caps using orbital mirrors or ground-based heating. Goal: raise atmospheric pressure from 0.6 kPa toward 10-20 kPa.

PHASE 2 (200+ years): Introduce engineered greenhouse gases (PFCs). Goal: warm Mars surface by 10-20°C for liquid surface water.

PHASE 3 (500+ years): Biological oxygen production via engineered cyanobacteria.

Cost: 40% of colony industrial output for 10 years (Phase 1 initiation only).
Risk: unknown cascading effects on subsurface ice, potential disruption of subsurface microbial life.
